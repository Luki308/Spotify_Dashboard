This side can help us find performers we listened to as often as other people or visualize artists we listened to most frequently. At the beginning, we choose which set of artists we want to use and for which artist the chart will be drawn. Below, we select the people for whom we want to see the chart, and the application visualizes our listens in the form of a flow chart. By default, they are divided into the years in which we listened to a particular artist most frequently, but it is also possible to analyze listens in terms of the most frequently listened songs or albums.

When we choose to divide them into songs or albums, we can select the number of end nodes for each of the selected individuals. If we want to view the data in table form, there is a button below that allows us to do so.
